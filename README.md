<h1 align="center">Hello ðŸ‘‹, My name is Saulo Pereira de Jesus</h1>

- ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm learning: **Python, Django and DB through College and Online Courses**

- ðŸŒŽ Languages I speak: **Portuguese and English**

- ðŸ“„ About my experiences: **I have participated in several Game Jams, and as a result, I know how to handle programming situations in a short period of time.**

- âš¡ Interesting fact about me: **I've always loved programming even without knowing much about it when I was a kid, and my dream was to make games. I tried to learn C# when I was eleven, but what made me fall in love with programming was this interest I've always had in learning something new, and I remain determined, but no longer in relation to game development, haha!**
